# Project : Autonomous hive monitor
Monitoring system for beehive using Ubidots STEM, Microsoft Azure and Arduino microcontroller.

### Features
- Monitoring hive activity
- Getting temperature and humidity inside and outside of the beehive
- Autonomous system thanks to a solar panel recharge



# What is the project ?
## Project presentation
The goal of this project is to assemble a system that monitor beehives activities.
This system has to be autonomous and reliable to allow apiarists to look after their apiary.
It will have a dashboard and able to send alert by mail or SMS, thanks to LPWAN (Low Power Wide Area Network)
